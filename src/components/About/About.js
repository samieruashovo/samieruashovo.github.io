              My expertise lies in Flutter, where I design and develop
              full-featured mobile applications with clean architecture, MVVM architecture
              and state management solutions like and BloC & GetX.
              Iâ€™ve worked on various apps, from productivity tools to
              games, including my published 2048 - Number Merge game,
              which features multiple themes, customizable board sizes,
              and a sleek UI.
              I also focus on app performance optimization,
              offline-first architectures, and native
              integrations to ensure smooth user experiences
              across devices.

              Iâ€™m also deeply interested in machine learning and computer vision.
              Recently, I trained a YOLO model on a marine debris dataset to detect
              objects like cans, foam, plastic, and bottles. I enjoy working on
              real-world AI applications and optimizing models for mobile and
              edge computing.
